**RL-Boy Reinforcement Kid** is a small-sized open-source robot project and a full-stack open-source scaled-down humanoid robot project. Centered around running end-to-end reinforcement learning algorithms, it has 22 degrees of freedom, including waist, hands, and head. Among small-sized robots, it fully possesses the ability to run end-to-end reinforcement learning algorithms and imitation learning algorithms. Meanwhile, due to having upper limbs, it can also run open-source software packages related to VLA operations. Reinforcement Kid has a 1-degree-of-freedom head and an OLED screen, so it can display expressions well, and combined with AI models, it can implement dialogue and interactive actions.

## Features of the Reinforcement Kid:
1. **Ultra-small size and high degree of freedom:** The enhanced small robot has 22 degrees of freedom, with a rotatable waist and head, but is only 55 cm tall.
2. **End-to-end network drive:** The reinforcement agent can implement the RL deep reinforcement learning algorithm, while the upper limb can implement operations by running the VLA model, thus realizing the development of the cerebellum-cerebrum fusion algorithm.
3. **Open source of whole-link power builder:** In addition to open-sourcing robot mechanical design and BOM diagram materials, the robot's upper and lower computer software, as well as the onnx model deployment framework, have been open-sourced. The model deployment framework is fully synchronized with isacc and sim2sim scripts.
4. **Provide remote control equipment:** Provide servo-based dual-arm remote control software that can meet the data acquisition requirements for controlling and supporting the upper limbs and waist of the robot.

## Basic Performance of the Reinforcement Kid:

| **Degree of Freedom** | **Control System**       | **Reinforcement Learning**       | **Embodied Operation**       | **Facial Interaction**       | **Remote Control Operation**       |

## Software Version Update

### Method for updating firmware to V1.0:
1. Updated the new URDF to be consistent with the actual robot in fidelity.
2. Optimized the training software architecture.
3. Updated the hardware design and added different head solutions.
4. Embedded software updated to OmniRobLabV1.0.

### Configuration Instructions:
1. **Router Name:** Tinker-2.4G-ID Number, **Password:** 11111111.
2. **HMI Host Computer Configuration for STM32 Board:** Connect the Core and Extcan circuit boards via USB, complete the motor reverse checkbox and motor type selection according to the configuration diagram, and each motor completes CAN_ID configuration through its own Dami host computer:
